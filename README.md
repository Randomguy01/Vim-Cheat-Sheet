## Summary
This Repository was created as an easy way to quickly and reliably find How-Tos and commands to perform actions in Vim. The majority of the documents contained in this repo are coming from Vim documents, rewriteen in fewer words. It is important to know that these documents are written in a way that I will understand best, and will not necessarily be understandable for others (sometimes what I write will be complete gibberish that makes sense to me, so sorry).
